            99% of video editors out there are focused on getting through your video as fast as possible to move on to the next client and collect their money. That's why their work is souless, generic, and unoriginal. In contrast, I work very closely with you, always pushing the limits with my editing while keeping your brand and vision in mind to make the best content possible and bring you the best ROI.

            After we start working together, we'll have an alignment meeting to get on the same page about how your content should be. I'll ask questions like:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>“If someone binge-watched 5 of your videos, what word should they walk away with?”</li>
              <li>“What emotion should still land even if the video had no visuals?”</li>
              <li>“What’s totally off-brand for you, even if it could go viral?”</li>
            </ul>
            These types of questions allow me to edit in your voice, <em>but better.</em>

      <div class="accordion">
        <div class="accordion-header">
          <span class="question" data-text="How do you avoid revisions?">3. How do you avoid revisions?</span>

            Revisions usually happen for one of two reasons:
            <ul class="bullet-list">
              <li>Your editor is sloppy and doesn't pay attention to detail.</li>
              <li>They're misaligned and disconnected from you and your brand.</li>
            </ul>
            This is why the alignment call is so important.

            Once we begin, you’ll get access to a private dashboard where everything is tracked in real time as I edit: rough cuts, asset gathering, music, SFX, etc. This eliminates unnecessary back-and-forth like, “Hey, how’s the video going?”

            It’s rare, but if something’s off, I’ll work hard to fix it and also figure out where the disconnect came from. Was it miscommunication? Something on my end? I’ll get to the bottom of it and make sure it doesn’t happen again.

            That depends on the scope. Tight deadline + complex work = higher investment. If you've got something particular in mind, send me a message on X

            There’s no one-size-fits-all price. Just as you wouldn’t quote a house without plans, I won’t quote a project without understanding your needs. Anyone who does is after a sale, not delivering real value.
